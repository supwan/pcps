Here are some potential bugs and issues in your main.cpp code:

1. **Case Sensitivity in "Same Day" vs "Same day"**
In your packages array, you have both "Same day" and "Same Day" (lowercase and uppercase "d"). This inconsistency could cause problems if you later compare or filter by duration string values.

2. **Input Validation Loops May Not Work as Expected**
If the user enters invalid input (like a letter instead of a number) when asked for a package number, laundry weight, or distance, the `cin` stream will enter a fail state and stop reading input. Your code currently does not clear the error state or ignore the invalid input, so it could get stuck in an infinite loop or behave unexpectedly.

**Example:**
```cpp
cin >> selectedOption;
// If input is not an integer, cin fails and selectedOption is unchanged
```
**Solution:**
Add input validation to clear the error state and ignore invalid input.

3. **Confirmation Variable Might Not Be Initialized**
If the user enters an invalid option, confirmation will remain uninitialized and could cause undefined behavior when checked in the loop condition:
```cpp
} while (selectedOption < 1 || selectedOption > 6 || confirmation == 'n');
```
If the first run is invalid, `confirmation` will not be set before being checked.

4. **Negative or Zero Laundry Weight**
You check for `laundryWeight < 0`, but zero is also an invalid laundry weight. You probably want:
```cpp
while (laundryWeight <= 0)
```

5. **Negative or Zero Delivery Distance**
You check for `deliveryDistance < 0`, but a zero delivery distance could be valid for "door-to-door" service if the user is next door. However, you should clarify if zero distance is allowed.

6. **Uninitialized Delivery Fee for Self-Service**
For self-service (chosen == 1 or 4), deliveryDistance is 0, so deliveryFee is 0, which seems fine. But if you expand the code, watch for cases where deliveryFee should not be included at all.

7. **No Protection Against Division by Zero**
Currently, there is no division by zero in your code, but if you add more features (like per-distance pricing), be careful.

8. **No Check for Non-Numeric Input**
If the user enters non-numeric characters for numeric fields, input will fail as noted above. You should clear the stream for robust input.

---

**Summary of Key Fixes:**
- Add robust input validation for all user input.
- Initialize `confirmation` before use, or restructure the input loop.
- Standardize string values for consistency.
- Check for zero laundry weight.
